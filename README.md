slimshortener
=============
Note: I originally wanted to build this URL shortener on the PHP slim framework (hence the name) but I decided to be more adventurous and went with node.js and the express framework. 

key node packages used:
mongoose - mongodb ODM
random-string - random string generator


Slim shortener is an open-sourced URL shortener you can install quickly on your own VPS.
